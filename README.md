### [T8] Subatomically Perfect Water (Grade 8)

#### Components

To build a setup, you will need:
- Adapter: 2
- Transposer: 1
- MFU: 1

#### Description

To use the module for t8 water in the `config.lua`
You must also specify the address of the transposer in the `transposerAddress` 
field, which is located under the hv input bus and to which the interface with the Quarks connected.
Also the address of the adapter connected to me interface in the `subMeInterfaceAddress` field.
Also in the configs you can change the number of quarks the computer must support in this field ` maxQuarkCount`.

The controller is connected via MFU to keep it accessible.

The idea is that a separate subnet is made for quarks. The Absolute Baryonic Perfection Purification Unit returns unused quarks and 2 
Unaligned Quark Releasing Catalysts after crafting is complete. The computer looks to see which quarks are less than the specified 
number (`maxQuarkCount` in the default configs is 4) and orders them. That is, the subnet must have at least 2 CPUs and a 
Hyper-Intensity Laser Engraver connected to order quarks. It is possible without a subnet, but the condition is that the computer can order quarks. 
Stabilized Baryonic Matter can be fed into the subsystem or directly into the Laser Engraver.

> [!NOTE]  
> Maximum 42 infinity ingots used per cycle. But usually less. Consumption can be 6, 18, 42 ingots per cycle. Depends on luck.

#### T8 Config part

```Lua
t8 = { -- Controller for T8 Subatomically Perfect Water (Grade 8)
  enable = false, -- Enable module for T8 water
  controller = t8controllerLib:newFormConfig({
    maxQuarkCount = 4, -- Maximum number of each quark in the sub AE
    transposerAddress = "aaaaaaaa-aaaa-aaaa-aaaa-aaaaaaaaaaaa", -- Address of transposer which provide Quarks
    subMeInterfaceAddress = "aaaaaaaa-aaaa-aaaa-aaaa-aaaaaaaaaaaa" -- Address of me interface which connected to sub AE
  })
}
```

## Configuration

General configuration in file `config.lua`
The configuration of water line modules is described in paragraph [Water Line Setup](#water-line-setup).

Enable auto update when starting the program.

```lua
enableAutoUpdate = true, -- Enable auto update on start
```

In the `timeZone` field you can specify your time zone.

In the `discordWebhookUrl` field, you can specify the Discord Webhook link so that the program sends messages to the discord about emergency situations.
[How to Create a Discord Webhook?](https://www.svix.com/resources/guides/how-to-make-webhook-discord/)

```lua
logger = loggerLib:newFormConfig({
  name = "Water Line Control",
  timeZone = 3, -- Your time zone
  handlers = {
    discordLoggerHandler:newFormConfig({
      logLevel = "warning",
      messageFormat = "{Time:%d.%m.%Y %H:%M:%S} [{LogLevel}]: {Message}",
      discordWebhookUrl = "" -- Discord Webhook URL
    }),
    fileLoggerHandler:newFormConfig({
      logLevel = "debug",
      messageFormat = "{Time:%d.%m.%Y %H:%M:%S} [{LogLevel}]: {Message}",
      filePath = "logs.log"
    }),
    scrollListLoggerHandler:newFormConfig({
      logLevel = "debug",
      logsListSize = 32
    }),
  }
}),
```
